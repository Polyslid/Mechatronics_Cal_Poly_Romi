This project consists of a robot named Romi that will travel through a premade track with multiple checkpoints. A black line connects each of these checkpoints to each other that Romi will use to reach each 
checkpoint via a line sensor, however between each checkpoint there is an obstacle that hinders the capabilities of the line sensor or removes the possibility of using it entirely. In order to compensate for this,
other means of navigation are required, such as an IMU that determiens the robots orientation.
